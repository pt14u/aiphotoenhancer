            <p><strong>AI Photo Enhancer processes all images 100% locally on your device.</strong> Your photos never leave your phone, tablet, or computer. We do not upload, store, or access your photos on any servers. The only internet connection used by our app is for displaying advertisements through approved ad networks.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to AI Photo Enhancer ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "Application").</p>
            <p>Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the Application.</p>
            
            <h3>1.1 Local Processing Commitment</h3>
            <p>We want to emphasize our core privacy principle: <strong>All photo processing occurs locally on your device.</strong> The artificial intelligence models that enhance your photos are downloaded to your device and run entirely on your device's processor. No image data is transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers during the enhancement process.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            
            <h3>2.1 Information You Provide to Us</h3>
            <p>We collect minimal information that you provide directly to us, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Photos you select for enhancement:</strong> These photos are processed exclusively on your device and are never transmitted to us or any third party.</li>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>2.3 What We DO NOT Collect</h3>
            <p>To provide complete transparency, we explicitly state what we do NOT collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>We do NOT collect or access your photos.</strong> All photos remain on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>We do NOT upload your photos to any server.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>We do NOT use your photos for training our AI models.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>We do NOT share your photos with third parties.</strong></li>

        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>To Provide the Service:</strong> To enable the photo enhancement features that run locally on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>To Improve Our Application:</strong> To understand how users interact with our Application and to improve its performance, features, and user experience.</li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. Local Processing Architecture</h2>
            <p>Our Application is designed with privacy-first architecture:</p>
            
            <h3>4.1 On-Device AI Processing</h3>
            <p>The core functionality of AI Photo Enhancer relies on neural networks that run entirely on your device. When you enhance a photo:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The photo is loaded into your device's memory</li>
                <li>Our AI models (already downloaded to your device) process the image</li>
                <li>The enhanced result is saved to your device's storage</li>
                <li>All intermediate data is cleared from memory</li>
                <li>No data is transmitted over the internet during this process</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>4.2 Offline Functionality</h3>
            <p>The Application's photo enhancement features work completely offline. You do not need an internet connection to enhance your photos. Internet connection is only required for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Downloading the Application and updates</li>
                <li>Displaying advertisements (in the free version)</li>
                <li>Optional feedback submission</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>4.3 Data Storage</h3>
            <p>All photos, both original and enhanced, are stored only on your device in locations you designate (typically your device's gallery or photos app). We do not have access to these storage locations.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>5. Advertising</h2>
            
            <h3>5.1 Ad Networks</h3>
            <p>The free version of AI Photo Enhancer displays advertisements to support development and maintenance. We use third-party advertising networks that comply with industry standards. These networks may collect information to serve relevant ads, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Device identifiers</li>
                <li>IP address (general location for ad targeting)</li>
                <li>Information about ad interactions</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>5.2 Ad Privacy</h3>
            <p>Advertising partners have their own privacy policies governing the information they collect. We encourage you to review these policies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google AdMob: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a></li>
                <li>Huawei Ads: <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/en/privacy/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a></li>
                <li>Other ad networks as applicable</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>5.3 Ad-Free Option</h3>
            <p>You can remove advertisements by upgrading to the premium version of AI Photo Enhancer, which eliminates all internet connectivity requirements except for initial download and updates.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We implement appropriate technical measures to protect the minimal information we collect. However, please be aware that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>
            
            <h3>6.1 Your Device's Security</h3>
            <p>Since all photo processing occurs on your device, the security of your photos depends largely on your device's security settings. We recommend:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using device passcodes or biometric authentication</li>
                <li>Keeping your operating system updated</li>
                <li>Only installing apps from trusted sources</li>
